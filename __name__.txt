If the source file is executed as the main program, the interpreter sets the __name__ variable to have a 
value “__main__”. If this file is being imported from another module, __name__ will be set to the module’s name.
__name__ is a built-in variable which evaluates to the name of the current module. Thus it can be used to check 
whether the current script is being run on its own or being imported somewhere else by combining it with if
 statement,


# File1.py 
  
print "File1 __name__ = %s" %__name__ 
  
if __name__ == "__main__": 
    print "File1 is being run directly"
else: 
    print "File1 is being imported"


python File1.py
Output :
File1 __name__ = __main__
File1 is being run directly



# File2.py 
  
import File1 
  
print "File2 __name__ = %s" %__name__ 
  
if __name__ == "__main__": 
    print "File2 is being run directly"
else: 
    print "File2 is being imported"



python File2.py
Output :
File1 __name__ = File1
File1 is being imported
File2 __name__ = __main__
File2 is being run directly
