In computer networks, a packet is a container or box that carries data over a TCP/IP network and internetworks.
 A packet is the most fundamental logical arbitration of data that is passed over a network.

A packet normally represents the smallest amount of data that can traverse over a network at a single time. 
A TCP/IP network packet contains several pieces of information, including the data it is carrying, source
 destination IP addresses, and other constraints required for quality of service and packet handling.

Header - The header contains instructions about the data carried by the packet. These instructions may include:
Length of packet (some networks have fixed-length packets, while others rely on the header to contain this information)
Synchronization (a few bits that help the packet match up to the network)
Packet number (which packet this is in a sequence of packets)
Protocol (on networks that carry multiple types of information, the protocol defines what type of packet is being transmitted: e-mail, Web page, streaming video)
Destination address (where the packet is going)
Originating address (where the packet came from)


Payload - Also called the body or data of a packet. This is the actual data that the packet is delivering to the destination. If a packet is fixed-length, then
 the payload may be padded with blank information to make it the right size.


Trailer - The trailer, sometimes called the footer, typically contains a couple of bits that tell the receiving device that it has reached the end of the packet.
 It may also have some type of error checking. The most common error checking used in packets is Cyclic Redundancy
 Check (CRC)
